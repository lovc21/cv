## Projects
**[*.GOV Web Crawler*](https://github.com/lovc21/web_crawler_Kurtz)**

Built a web crawler project specializing in scraping .gov websites and storing data in a PostgreSQL database. Key features include concurrent scraping, support for robot.txt and sitemap.xml files, duplicate page handling, and crawl management using an SQLite database.

**[*Numerical analysis in Julija*](https://github.com/Numerical-analysis-in-julija)**

During a course in numerical mathematics, I solved several numerical tasks using the Julia programming language. The tasks were approached as if building a library of numerical functions, complete with full CI/CD support, standalone documentation, and  testing.

**[*Photo Gallery Editor Microservice.*](https://github.com/RSO-project-Prepih)**

Build a microservice application that allows users to upload photos to a gallery and retrieve detailed information from a given picture. The app employs a cloud-native approach, and its architecture consists of multiple microservices. The backend is developed in Go and Node.js, while the frontend is built using React. The project is deployed on Google Cloud using Kubernetes and Docker for containerization. Additionally, the project boasts full CI/CD and monitoring support utilizing CircleCI, Prometheus and Grafana
