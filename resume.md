## EXPERIENCE

### [Flare Networks](https://www.flare.network/)

**DevOps/SRE, May 2025 - Present, Remote**

- Introduced distroless images, which reduced the image sizes for our validators and minimized the attack surface.
- Using Python and Terraform, created a backup system that backs up databases to multiple clouds.
- Using Packer, created secure golden images that are used at different exchanges.
- Implemented CI components in our GitLab CI, which reduced the CI code and made it easier to upgrade our deployment process.

### [DevRev](https://devrev.ai/)

**DevOps/SRE,  Dec 2023 - Feb 2025, Ljubljana, Slovenia**

- Provisioned two new AWS regions in Europe and Australia. Set up the CI pipeline, EKS, ArgoCD and MongoDB. Automated this process using Python, making it possible to deploy new regions in a week.
- Migrated all of our services from [Bazel](https://bazel.build/) build system to a homegrown build system that I helped develop.
- Set up [Snyk](https://snyk.io) static code analysis tool to help us upgrade all of our dependencies and prevent exploits in our code.
- Worked on switching Kubernetes nodes from Intel to AMD, which were 7\% cheaper for the same performance.
- Resolved production incidents while communicating with customers, and provided support to engineers.

### [Comtrade 360](https://www.comtrade360.com/)

**Software Engineer, Jul 2022 - Jul 2023, Ljubljana, Slovenia**

- Contributed to the [Comtrade Fast File System](https://www.comtrade360.com/comtrade-distributed-file-system) and [EOS File System](https://eos-web.web.cern.ch/eos-web/) in collaboration with [CERN OpenLab](https://openlab.cern/).
- Developed a Prometheus monitoring system that collected HDD and SSD SMART data, which was used in machine learning programs.
- Using Java Spring Boot, worked on several backend projects for Hewlett Packard Enterprise.

### [ARNES - Academic and Research Network of Slovenia](https://www.arnes.si/en/home/)

**Network Engineer and Systems Administrator, Mar 2021 - Oct 2021, Ljubljana, Slovenia**

- Developed in Python a program that assists network admins in configuring Nvidia switches using the OpenFlow protocol based on the principle of software defined networking.
- Assisted with system administration tasks and network configuration at the \href{<https://six.si/en/about-us}{SIX}> network exchange point.
- Led the effort to refurbish old servers and network switches to be donated to schools around Slovenia for educational purposes.

## PROJECTS AND CONTRIBUTIONS

**[.GOV Web Crawler](https://github.com/lovc21/web_crawler_Kurtz)**
Built a web crawler specializing in scraping .gov websites and storing data in a PostgreSQL database. Key features include concurrent scraping, support for robot.txt and sitemap.xml files, duplicate page handling, and crawl management using SQLite.

**[Numerical Analysis in Julia](https://github.com/Numerical-analysis-in-julija)**
During a course in numerical mathematics, solved several numerical tasks using the Julia programming language. The tasks were approached as if building a library of numerical functions, complete with CI/CD, documentation and full unit test coverage.

**[Photo Gallery Editor Microservice](https://github.com/RSO-project-Prepih)**
Built a microservice application that allows users to upload photos to a gallery and retrieve detailed information from a given picture. The backend is developed in Go and Node.js, while the frontend is built using React. The project is deployed on Google Cloud using Kubernetes and Docker. Additionally, the project has CI/CD pipelines in CircleCI and monitoring using Prometheus and Grafana.

**[Chess Engine NeuroSpeed](https://github.com/lovc21/NeuroSpeed)**
Created a UCI-compliant chess engine in the Zig programming language, specifically designed for playing bullet games against strong chess engines. This project is still a work in progress and is not yet finished.
